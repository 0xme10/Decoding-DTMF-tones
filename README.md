# Decoding-DTMF-tones
Dual-tone multi-frequency (DTMF) signals are tones generated by sinusoidal signal.
These sinusoidal signals are used by pressing a telephone keypad. Each keypad is coded to a
signal that is composed of a sum of two sinusoids.
Signal Processing to Decode up to N number of tones using matlab.
The algorithm uses FFT to calculate the DFT then uses minPeaks to decode the keys pressed.
